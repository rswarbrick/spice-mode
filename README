recently.

Additional standards:
  Hspice (TM) : Commercial Spice, formerly Meta Software, now owned by Synopsys
  Eldo (TM)   : Commercial Spice, formerly Anacad, now owned by Mentor Graphics
  EldoRf (TM) : RF Steady State analyses of Eldo
  EldoVlogA   : Verilog-A extensions to Eldo netlist language
  FastHenry   : Multipole-accelerated inductance analysis program from MIT
  Layla       : KULeuven LAYLA (layout synthesis) extensions to Spice format
  Mondriaan   : KULeuven MONDRIAAN (layout synthesis) extensions
  DracCDL (TM): Dracula CDL extensions (Cadence LOGLVS netlists)

For installation and (site or user) customization information, see the
documentation. Generate it from spice-mode.texinfo by running a
command like
